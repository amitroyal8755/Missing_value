        "\n",
        "1. **Deck**:\n",
        "   - The `deck` column is joined with other columns at a very high distance, indicating that it has a unique pattern of missing data. This suggests that `deck` has many missing values that are not similarly missing in other columns.\n",

        "2. **Age** and **Alone**:\n",
        "   - `age` and `alone` are clustered together at a lower height, indicating that they have similar missing data patterns. This suggests that rows missing `age` data might also frequently miss the `alone` data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adult_male, Alive, Class, Who**:\n",
        "   - These columns are grouped together, suggesting they share similar missing data patterns. They are joined at a moderate height, indicating a reasonable level of similarity in their patterns of missingness.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pclass, Embarked, Embark_town, Sex, Survived, SibSp, Parch, Fare**:\n",
        "   - These columns are joined at a lower height, indicating a high similarity in their missing data patterns. It suggests that if a row is missing data in one of these columns, it is likely missing data in others within this group as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Unique Missing Pattern**:\n",
        "  - The `deck` column stands out with a unique missing pattern, different from all other columns, likely due to a high rate of missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Related Missingness**:\n",
        "  - `Age` and `Alone` columns share similar missing patterns, possibly indicating that the absence of age data might be associated with the absence of alone status data.\n",
        "  - The cluster of `adult_male`, `alive`, `class`, and `who` indicates these columns have correlated missingness.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High Similarity Group**:\n",
        "  - Columns such as `pclass`, `embarked`, `embark_town`, `sex`, `survived`, `sibsp`, `parch`, and `fare` are very similar in their missing data patterns. This suggests that missing data in one of these columns is often accompanied by missing data in others.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Practical Implications\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Imputation Strategy**:\n",
        "  - Treat columns within the same cluster similarly for imputation purposes. For instance, `age` and `alone` might be imputed together using similar techniques or based on each other.\n",
        "  - Pay special attention to `deck` due to its unique missing pattern, which might require a different imputation strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Quality Improvement**:\n",
        "  - Investigate why `deck` has a different missing pattern and whether this indicates a systemic issue in data collection.\n",
        "  - Understanding which columns tend to be missing together can help in diagnosing and fixing issues in the data collection process.\n",
